# Set up the router

The first step would be to set up the router. I made the choice of
[OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) for many good reasons:

- Known to be pretty stable
- Firewall focused
- With a good enough UI
- Accessible to people less comfortable with network stuff
- Can do routing, firewall, dhcp, dns, vpn (wireguard), haproxy and others

I mainly followed the tutorials from
[HomeNetworkGuy](https://homenetworkguy.com/), notably:

- [Set Up a Fully Functioning Home Network Using OPNsense](https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/set-up-a-fully-functioning-home-network-using-opnsense/)
- [How to Connect to Your Home Network via WireGuard VPN Server in OPNsense](https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/configure-wireguard-opnsense/)
- [How to Configure IPv6 in Your Home Network with ISP such as Comcast Xfinity](https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/configure-ipv6-opnsense-with-isp-such-as-comcast-xfinity/)
